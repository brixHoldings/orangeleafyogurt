        <Title>OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT TO YOU</Title>
        <Text>
          Orange Leaf, LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (Orange Leaf FC, LLC) (collectively, “Orange
          Leaf,” “we,” or “us”), operates a variety of websites or mobile applications, including
          www.orangeleafyogurt.com, the Orange Leaf mobile application (“Application”), and any other site, mobile
          application, or online service where Orange Leaf Terms and Conditions of Use are posted (collectively, the
          “Sites”), and is committed to protecting the privacy of our Site users (“Users”) and Orange Leaf Rewards
          members (“Members”). This notice applies only to information collected or submitted on the Sites. To that end,
          we offer this privacy policy to inform our Members and Users (referred to individually, or collectively, as
          “you”) of how we collect, use and disclose your personal information (“Privacy Policy”). Orange Leaf strives
          to take reasonable steps to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and
          applicable laws. By using the Sites, you agree to the collection and use of your information as described
          herein regardless of whether or not you have read this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy
          Policy, do not access the Sites. We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy and will post
          any changes on this page so that you are aware of what information we collect and how we use it. We encourage
          you to check this page regularly. Your continued use of any of the Sites following any changes will constitute
          your acceptance of such changes.
        </Text>

        <Title>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</Title>
        <Text>
          There are several types of information we collect on the Sites. On some pages, you can voluntarily provide
          personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address and phone number when you contact us
          with an inquiry, request, or suggestion, provide feedback on our products, participate in a marketing program,
          sweepstakes, contest or survey, respond to an offer, or register to receive promotional materials. If you are
          interested in applying for a job at Orange Leaf, we may collect your resume. Holders of any Orange Leaf
          Rewards loyalty and Orange Leaf® gift card may voluntarily register their cards on the Sites. When you
          purchase, register or reload (as applicable) your Orange Leaf Rewards loyalty and Orange Leaf gift card, we
          may collect the personally identifiable information listed above, financial information (credit card numbers,
          credit card expiration dates, etc.), and user profile and preferences information. After you have registered
          your e-mail address on the Sites and if you have signed into the Sites with your email address and password,
          or with other shared methods of authentication such as your Facebook® account, Orange Leaf may collect Site
          behavior and browser information as you navigate through the Sites. This information may be used to create a
          profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences, personal information and behavior.
          Consequently, collected information may be tied to the User’s personally identifiable information and may be
          used to provide offers and improve the content of the Sites for the User. This profile may also be used to
          tailor a User’s visit to our Sites, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to the User. We may also
          collect location data or the geographic position of your mobile device or use location-based technology in our
          retail locations, such as iBeacons, to collect information about the presence of your mobile device, if the
          Bluetooth is turned on and your device settings allow for this.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          We may also collect personal information from other sources. For example, we may purchase third party
          marketing data and add it to our existing databases of User and Member information to better target our
          advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our Users and Members would be interested in. We use this
          information to enhance or overlay the ‘profile’ of individual Users. This aggregate marketing data may
          therefore be tied to the User’s or Member’s personally identifiable information. We do not knowingly collect
          personally identifiable information from visitors to the Sites who are under 13 years of age.
        </Text>

        <Title>HOW DOES ORANGE LEAF HANDLE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN?</Title>
        <Text>
          Please note that Orange Leaf has no intention of collecting personal information from individuals under the
          age of 13 (“children”). We are committed to protecting children’s privacy on the Internet and we comply fully
          with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Where appropriate, we will instruct children not to
          provide such information to us. If a parent becomes aware that a child has provided us with personal
          information, we ask that the parent or legal guardian of the child contact us via the Contact Us section of
          the Sites, or in writing to Orange Leaf, Attn: Online Privacy, 14850 Montfort Drive, Suite 131 PMB22, Dallas,
          TX 75254, to request that this information be deleted from our records.
        </Text>

        <Title>DOES ORANGE LEAF USE COOKIE TECHNOLOGY?</Title>
        <Text>
          Orange Leaf may use cookie technology to make your use of the Sites more convenient and to support our
          internal business purposes. A cookie is a piece of information that is transferred to a User’s hard drive for
          record-keeping purposes. For example, our Sites may use cookies to remember your e-mail address so that you
          will not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site. Orange Leaf may also use cookies to
          help track referrals from third party web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you
          can set up your browser to alert you every time a cookie is offered, letting you decide whether or not to
          accept it. You can use and visit the Site with cookies disabled, but you will not automatically be recognized
          by the Site upon re-visiting. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our Sites’ best
          features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Some of our business partners may use cookies on our Sites (for example, advertising partners). However, we
          have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies.
        </Text>

        <Title>WHAT OTHER MECHANISMS DOES ORANGE LEAF USE TO TRACK USER BEHAVIOR?</Title>
        <Text>
          Some Site web pages and HTML-formatted e-mails and e-newsletters may use web beacons to compile statistics
          about Web Site usage. A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1×1) or clear GIF. Web
          beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor’s computer, such as a visitor’s cookie number,
          time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may render
          some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Orange Leaf and its third party vendors may use web beacons to track and analyze non-personally identifiable
          usage information and to compile statistical information about Users in order to improve the Sites’ quality
          and to support our business. All data collected on behalf of Orange Leaf is owned and used by Orange Leaf.
          Orange Leaf reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Users
          for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for business partners.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          We may also collect information in log files that include data such as internet protocol (IP) addresses,
          browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and
          number of clicks. We and our business partners may use this information to analyze trends, administer the
          Site, track User’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP
          addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          We may also collect information about the location of your device, such as information that identifies your
          device’s precise location (for example, GPS latitude and longitude level) or its approximate location (e.g.
          less precise location estimated based on a browser or device’s IP address). We may also use location-based
          technology in our retail locations, such as iBeacons, to collect information about the presence of your
          device, if your Bluetooth is turned on and your device settings allow for this. We collect this information or
          derive it from your GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth or other device settings for purposes of enhancing or facilitating
          our services, such as to enable the functionality of our websites or mobile applications that provide you with
          information about stores near you, to enable you to remotely order and pay for our products and services, or
          so that you may have certain Orange Leaf products delivered to you by a third-party vendor. We may also use
          information about the location of the device you are using to help us understand how our websites, mobile
          applications, and other services and functionality are being used, or to deliver more relevant advertising or
          personalized experiences for you, including tailored marketing offers or messages based on your location or
          related context such as the time of day or weather.
        </Text>

        <Title>THE WAY WE USE INFORMATION</Title>
        <Text>
          Orange Leaf uses the personal information you provide for the purposes for which it was provided, for example, to support an Orange
          Leaf Rewards program; to notify you that you have won a contest or sweepstakes; to respond to your inquiries
          or complaints; or to contact you or send you information about your membership. In addition, Orange Leaf, its
          subsidiaries, affiliates and their franchisees may share and use information collected through the Sites to
          administer and manage our business, including, for example, to address customer complaints; for account
          maintenance purposes; in connection with information technology services; to detect, prevent, or investigate
          security breaches or fraud; and to maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes. Personal
          information may also be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their
          preferences and behavior. This profile may be used to develop and improve the products, benefits and services
          that Orange Leaf, its subsidiaries and their franchisees, and business partners offer to our Members or Users,
          to operate, improve, service and maintain the Sites and the associated user experience, and to develop
          pertinent marketing promotions to Users and Members. Further, we may access, use or disclose your personally
          identifiable information to provide targeted e-mails, text messages, surveys, or promotional offers to you;
          analyze the Sites to make it more effective; or for other general internal business purposes. If you opt in,
          we may send you promotions, special offers and alerts to you via text message. You may opt out to stop
          receiving these text messages at any time.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          In connection with any Orange Leaf Rewards loyalty and Orange Leaf gift cards, we will use the information
          collected to create an easy-to-use and convenient way to process your transactions and provide you information
          about your Orange Leaf Rewards loyalty and Orange Leaf gift card balances. Financial information is not used
          for any other purpose than billing.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          We may use third party contractors to help us operate our business and the Sites or administer activities on
          our behalf, such as authorize credit card transactions. We may share your personally identifiable information
          with these contractors for those limited purposes. We may use non-identifying and aggregate information about
          the Sites and Users for internal purposes and we may share it with third parties to illustrate trends and user
          demographics. We may periodically remove from personal information data that can be used to identify
          individuals for example by summarizing, aggregating or removing certain data elements. The resulting cleaned
          data is no longer considered personal information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. The cleaned data
          may be published by Orange Leaf and provided to various third parties.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          We may transfer your personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition, dissolution,
          or similar event. We may also use and disclose your personal information to parties connected with the
          contemplated or actual financing, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our business
          or assets, including for the purposes of determining whether to proceed or continue with such transaction or
          business relationship or fulfilling any records or other reporting requirements to such parties. We may
          require such parties to treat your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to use and
          disclose it only for the purposes for which it was collected. Where permitted or required by law, Orange Leaf
          may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent, for example in response to a
          court order or subpoena or to comply with a legally permitted inquiry by a government agency or protect the
          interests or safety of Orange Leaf or other Users.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Please note that if you disclose your personal information in a manner that will be posted publicly, such as
          in a product review or photograph you post on our Sites, or share with others through media sharing
          applications such as Instagram®, Pinterest® or Tumblr®, your posting will be seen by others. In addition, if
          you elect to participate in certain community features offered from time to time, selected information about
          you may be shared with other participants in these community features. Also, Orange Leaf may make it possible
          for certain third party web sites to be accessed directly from our Sites and for selected information about
          you to be provided to these third party web sites if you are also a user of these third party web sites. If a
          third party web site allows other users to view information about you (e.g. through posting to a publicly
          available profile page), the information provided by Orange Leaf will be visible to other users of the third
          party web site.
        </Text>

        <Title>WHEN WILL I BE CONTACTED BY ORANGE LEAF?</Title>
        <Text>
          You may receive products and communications associated with your transactions with Orange Leaf, such as
          purchases, sweepstakes and contests. You may also receive communications from Orange Leaf related to
          transactions that appear to be from you or which appear to be fraudulent. You may be contacted in regards to
          an issue on your account or in response to a customer service contact initiated by you or in response to a
          specific request from you such as clicking on a “forgot my password” link. Any administrative communications
          also may be accompanied by information about products and services, special offers and upcoming promotions or
          events offered by Orange Leaf, our subsidiaries and their franchisees or our marketing partners that we think
          may be of interest to you (“direct marketing”). You may periodically receive from Orange Leaf, its
          subsidiaries and their franchisees unsolicited direct marketing communications by mail (delivered via the
          United States Postal Service). Orange Leaf and its subsidiaries and their franchisees aspire to send
          standalone direct marketing e-mail communications to you only if you have previously opted in to receiving
          such communications. We support the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the
          following section: How Can I Out of Receiving Direct Marketing from Orange Leaf?
        </Text>

        <Title>HOW CAN I OPT OUT OF RECEIVING DIRECT MARKETING FROM ORANGE LEAF?</Title>
        <Text>
          By providing us with your personal information, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of that
          information as described in this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time or as described at or before the
          time of collection, use or disclosure, as the case may be. Orange Leaf is the owner of the personal
          information collected on our Sites. If you do not want your personal information to be collected, used or
          disclosed in this manner, please do not submit your personal information to us.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          If you would prefer that Orange Leaf not use your personal information for standalone direct marketing
          communications, subject to legal, or contractual restrictions and legal notice, you may opt out of such uses
          and/or disclosures by
        </Text>
        <Text>(a) checking the appropriate “Out” box in any applicable e-mail communication or e-newsletter,</Text>
        <Text>(b) visiting www.orangeleafyogurt.com, selecting ‘Contact Us’ and completing the contact form, or</Text>
        <Text>
          (c) writing to us at Orange Leaf, Attn: Online Customer Service, 14850 Montfort Drive, Suite 131 PMB22,
          Dallas, TX 75254
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Once you have opted out, your subsequent registration for our direct marketing services and promotions, such
          as our sweepstakes and contests may void, temporarily or permanently, your prior elections to opt out of
          receiving direct marketing communications from Orange Leaf. Please consult the applicable rules of the
          promotion or service before participating. Note that when you elect to opt out, we do not delete your personal
          information.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          As for mobile functionality, location services, push notifications and voice transmissions may be adjusted or
          disabled by you within your device settings. You may also be able to reject cookies, web beacons, entity tags
          and HTML5 local storage by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser. Each browser is different, but
          many browsers have preferences or options that may be adjusted to allow you to either accept or reject cookies
          and certain other technologies before they are set or installed, or allow you to remove or reject the use or
          installation of certain technologies altogether.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          E-mails that are sent to you as a result of you performing a business transaction with us or requesting
          specific information from Orange Leaf are not subject to an “Out” process. If you have any suggestions on how
          to improve these e-mails, please let us know by using the Contact Us functionality on the Site. We appreciate
          your feedback but cannot commit to taking action.
        </Text>
        <Title>HOW DOES ORANGE LEAF PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</Title>
        <Text>
          Orange Leaf aspires to take reasonable measures to protect the personal information it collects, uses, stores
          or discloses. We aspire to implement physical, technological and organizational procedures designed to protect
          the integrity and security, and to ensure the appropriate use, of your personal information. These procedures
          are proportional to the nature, sensitivity and format of the personal information collected, used, stored or
          disclosed by Orange Leaf. For example, Orange Leaf uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your
          financial information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology
          is the industry standard for secure online transactions.
        </Text>
        <Title>WHAT ABOUT LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES?</Title>
        <Text>
          This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Orange Leaf. However, our Sites may contain
          links to other web sites owned and operated by third parties. The third parties who operate these sites may
          treat the collection, use and disclosure of personal information differently than we do. This could be the
          case even for those web sites that carry Orange Leaf or its affiliates’ trademarks or logos or which are
          framed by our Sites. Please be aware that Orange Leaf is not responsible for the data collection, use and
          disclosure practices of companies or organizations to which our Sites may provide links. We encourage our
          Users to be aware when they leave our Sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that
          collects personally identifiable information.
        </Text>
        <Title>HOW CAN I ACCESS OR CORRECT MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</Title>
        <Text>
          If a User’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail or postal address),
          or if a User no longer desires our services, we provide a way to correct, update or deactivate Users’
          personally identifiable information. You can review or change some of your personal information by visiting
          the Site, entering your e-mail address and password and accessing the “My Account” area of the Site. Please
          note that in most cases, Orange Leaf will retain the previously entered data, and may even be prohibited by
          law from expunging certain data from its systems.
